You're thinking **exactly right** — and yes, **Option A (Chicken and Tomato Skillet with Rice)** is a great replacement, both **logistically and culinarily**.

You're spot on that:

* The ingredients (chicken, onion, garlic, canned tomatoes, rice, olive oil, paprika or herbs) are already used in other meals in **Shopping Block 1 and 2**, so:

  * You **won’t need to buy anything new**
  * You’ll **use up existing ingredients** more efficiently
  * You avoid regenerating shopping lists, keeping everything in sync

This makes the substitution **seamless** and improves the overall balance of the meal plan.

Now here’s your new **Meal 6**, formatted just like the others:

### Meal 14 – Pea & Potato Masala

*A simple, warm Indian-inspired dish with soft potatoes, sweet peas, and gentle spice. Can be served on its own or with flatbread, rice, or yogurt.*

---

#### Ingredients (1–2 servings):

* 2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced
* ¾ cup frozen green peas (or more to taste)
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1 tbsp cooking oil (sunflower or olive oil is fine)
* 1 tsp curry powder (or a blend of turmeric + cumin)
* ½ tsp salt (adjust to taste)
* Optional: chili flakes or fresh chili
* Optional: a small knob of butter or squeeze of lemon at the end

#### **Instructions**

1. **Prep the potatoes:**
   Peel and dice the potatoes into small cubes (\~1.5 cm). This helps them cook faster and blend nicely with the peas.

2. **Start the base:**
   Heat oil in a medium saucepan or deep frying pan over medium heat.
   Add chopped onion and cook for 3–4 minutes until soft and slightly golden.
   Add minced garlic and stir for 30 seconds until fragrant.

3. **Add the spices:**
   Sprinkle in curry powder (or turmeric + cumin).
   Stir into the onion/garlic base for 30–60 seconds — this blooms the spices and builds flavor.

4. **Add potatoes and water:**
   Add the diced potatoes and just enough water to **almost cover them** (about ¾–1 cup).
   Add salt. Stir to coat everything in the spiced oil.

5. **Simmer:**
   Cover the pan with a lid and **simmer gently** for 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are nearly tender.
   If the water is evaporating too fast, add a splash more.

6. **Add the peas:**
   Stir in the frozen peas.
   Continue simmering (uncovered) for another 5–7 minutes, until everything is soft and coated in a lightly thickened sauce.

7. **Final touches:**
   Taste and adjust salt.
   Add chili for heat, lemon for brightness, or a small spoon of butter for richness, depending on your mood.


#### Serving Ideas

* Eat it as-is with a spoon
* Pair with flatbread, toast, or plain rice
* Add a spoonful of plain yogurt for contrast


### 15. Chicken Rice Porridge (Congee Style)

A warm, comforting dish made by slowly simmering rice into a porridge texture, with tender chicken and ginger.

**Ingredients (1–2 servings):**

* ½ cup rice (uncooked)
* 4 cups water (or light chicken broth)
* 1 small chicken breast (raw)
* 1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced
* ½ tsp salt
* 1 tsp soy sauce (optional)
* Spring onion or sesame oil (optional)

**Instructions**

1. **Combine rice, water, and raw chicken** in a pot. Add sliced ginger and salt.
   (Yes — the chicken goes in raw. It will gently cook in the porridge as it simmers.)

2. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer uncovered or partly covered for **40–60 minutes**, stirring occasionally.

3. After 20–30 minutes, remove the chicken breast. Let it cool slightly and **shred it with a fork**.

4. Return shredded chicken to the pot. Continue simmering until the rice has broken down into a thick, creamy consistency (like soft oatmeal).
   If it gets too thick, add more water a bit at a time.

5. Season with soy sauce or extra salt to taste.
   Garnish with chopped spring onion or a drizzle of sesame oil if desired.


**Texture and Flavor Notes:**

* It should be soft, almost soup-like, but still spoonable.
* The ginger adds fragrance and warmth.
* It's comforting, minimal, and forgiving — you can't really overcook it.


#### What is “Congee,” really?

Congee (or rice porridge) is a dish where **rice is cooked in a large amount of water for a long time** — it breaks down into a thick, porridge-like texture. It’s not regular steamed rice with some toppings.

So the **key technique** is to simmer rice with extra water from the beginning and cook it well beyond the usual point, until the grains are very soft or partly dissolved.




### 16. Garlic Chicken with Potatoes & Greens

**Ingredients (1–2 servings):**

* 1 small chicken breast or thigh (cut into chunks or strips)
* 2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced
* 150–200g frozen spinach or other greens
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* ½ cup water or light broth
* Salt and pepper
* Optional: lemon juice, paprika, fresh herbs

**Instructions**

1. **Brown the chicken**

   * Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wide pan over medium-high heat.
   * Add chicken, season with salt and pepper, and brown on both sides (about 4–6 minutes total).
   * Add garlic and cook another 30 seconds.
   * Remove chicken and set aside.

2. **Sauté the potatoes**

   * Add the remaining 1 tbsp oil to the pan.
   * Add diced potatoes and cook uncovered for 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden.

3. **Steam until tender**

   * Add ½ cup water (or broth).
   * Cover the pan with a lid and let the potatoes steam for about 8–10 minutes, until fork-tender.
   * Remove the lid and let excess liquid evaporate if needed.

4. **Finish with spinach and chicken**

   * Return the browned chicken to the pan.
   * Add the frozen spinach on top.
   * Stir, then cook uncovered for another 3–5 minutes until everything is heated through and well combined.

5. **Final touches (optional)**

   * Add a squeeze of lemon juice or a drizzle of olive oil.
   * Season with additional pepper or herbs if desired.


**Result:**
Golden potatoes, flavorful browned chicken, and greens that don’t overpower the texture. Light but satisfying, and no watery mess.

* Optional: a drizzle of honey or chopped nuts.

**Variation**:  Mango Power Yoghurt Jar

*A rich, layered snack with tropical brightness and balanced texture*
**(1 jar or bowl – approx. 300–350 ml)**

#### Ingredients:

* 3–4 tbsp plain yoghurt (Greek or regular)
* 2 tbsp rolled oats (can be soaked ahead or added as-is for texture)
* 1/2 ripe **mango**, peeled and diced (or 1/3 if it’s large)
* 1 tsp **honey** (adjust to taste depending on mango sweetness)
* 1–2 tsp **raisins**
* 1–2 tsp mixed **seeds** (e.g., sunflower, pumpkin, chia, flax)
* Optional: 1–2 tsp chopped **nuts** (walnut, almond, cashew)
* A small **pinch of cinnamon**
* A few **fresh mint leaves**, torn or chopped
* Optional: small **drizzle of lemon juice** (or lime)
* Optional: **1/2 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder** (goes surprisingly well, but skip if mango is very ripe and sweet)

#### Instructions:

1. **Peel the mango** and cut into small cubes or thin slices.
2. In a jar or bowl, start with the **yoghurt**, then gently layer or fold in the **oats, mango, raisins, seeds**, and other mix-ins.
3. Add a **drizzle of honey**, a **sprinkle of cinnamon**, and finish with **mint** and a little **lemon juice** to brighten it up.
4. If using **nuts**, sprinkle on top or stir in gently.
5. Eat right away or let sit for 10–15 minutes to allow the oats and raisins to soften. For an overnight version, combine everything except mint and lemon juice and refrigerate. Add mint and citrus before serving.


#### Optional Swaps & Notes:

* Instead of raisins, you can also try **dried cranberries** for a tarter contrast.
* If your mango is **very juicy**, reduce or skip the lemon juice.
* A pinch of **salt** on top can surprisingly enhance flavor (optional but great).
* For variation: swap out yoghurt for **quark** or a **plant-based alternative** if desired.


### Saturday – Cucumber Sticks with Hummus

* Slice half a cucumber into sticks.
* Scoop 2–3 tablespoons of hummus into a small bowl or plate.
* Dip and snack.
* Optional: add a sprinkle of paprika or olive oil to the hummus.

#### Simple Classic Hummus (Beginner Friendly)

**Servings:** \~2–3
**Time:** 10–15 minutes

##### Ingredients

* 1 can (400g) cooked chickpeas (Kichererbsen), drained and rinsed
* 2–3 tbsp tahini (Sesampaste) – optional but gives authentic flavor
* 1 small garlic clove (or half if strong flavor is too much)
* Juice of ½ lemon (or to taste)
* 2–3 tbsp olive oil
* 2–4 tbsp cold water (for texture)
* ½ tsp salt (or to taste)
* Optional: pinch of cumin, paprika, or chili flakes

##### Instructions

   → Reserve a few for garnish if you like.

2. **Add everything to a container or bowl.**
   Chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and a splash of water.

3. **Blend until smooth.**
   Use a **stick blender** if you have one — pulse and move it around slowly.
   If you don’t have one, **mash with a fork** or potato masher for a rustic version.

4. **Adjust texture and taste.**
   Add more water for smoother hummus, more salt or lemon to balance flavor.

5. **Serve with a drizzle of olive oil.**
   Optional: sprinkle paprika, cumin, or chopped parsley on top.
