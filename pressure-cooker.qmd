# Introduction to Pressure Cooking

## What is a Pressure Cooker?

A pressure cooker is a sealed pot that uses **steam pressure** to cook food **faster** and often **more efficiently** than traditional methods. By sealing the steam inside, it raises both the **pressure** and the **boiling point** of water, allowing food to cook at **higher temperatures** without drying out or burning.

## How Does It Work?

* At **sea level**, water boils at **100°C (212°F)**. This limits how hot food and liquid in an open pot can get — no matter how long it boils.
* In a pressure cooker, steam builds up in a **sealed environment**, increasing the pressure to **1.5–2 times atmospheric pressure**.
* This increased pressure raises the **boiling point of water to around 115–120°C**.
* **Result**: Food cooks **30–70% faster**, stays **moist**, and retains **nutrients and flavor** more effectively.

## Why Higher Pressure = Higher Boiling Point

Boiling occurs when the **vapor pressure of the liquid equals the external pressure**. In a sealed pressure cooker:

* The **external pressure is higher**, so the water must reach a **higher temperature** before it can boil.
* This allows food to cook in **hotter water/steam** without evaporating liquid away.

This principle is the **opposite of what happens at high altitudes**, where **lower atmospheric pressure** causes water to boil at **lower temperatures**, leading to **longer cooking times**.

## Why Use a Pressure Cooker?

| Benefit                   | Explanation                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Faster cooking**        | Cuts time significantly for legumes, meats, and grains |
| **Tenderizes tough cuts** | Great for stews and braises                            |
| **No evaporation**        | Moisture is sealed in — perfect for soups and curries  |
| **Flavor concentration**  | Trapped steam keeps aromas and flavors more intense    |
| **Energy efficient**      | Less cooking time = lower gas or electricity usage     |

* 1 cup red lentils, rinsed and drained
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 medium potato, peeled and diced (optional for creaminess)
* 4 cups vegetable broth or water
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Juice of ½ lemon (for serving)
* Optional: chili flakes, fresh herbs, or a spoon of yogurt for topping

### Instructions

1. **Sauté aromatics**
   Set your pressure cooker to sauté mode (or heat it over medium heat if it's stovetop).
   Add olive oil. Sauté onion and carrot for about 3–4 minutes, until slightly soft.
   Add garlic, cumin, paprika, and turmeric. Stir for 30 seconds until fragrant.

2. **Add main ingredients**
   Add lentils, tomato paste, diced potato (if using), and broth or water. Stir well to combine.
   Season lightly with salt (you can adjust after cooking).

3. **Seal and cook**
   Lock the lid and bring to high pressure.
   Cook for 8 minutes at high pressure.
   After cooking, let the pressure release naturally for 5 minutes, then manually release the rest of the steam.

4. **Blend (optional)**
   The soup will be soft and creamy, but you can:

   * Use an immersion blender for a smoother texture
   * Or leave it chunky — both are great.

5. **Adjust and serve**
   Taste and adjust seasoning. Stir in lemon juice just before serving.
   Optionally, top with a drizzle of olive oil, chili flakes, or yogurt.

5. **Taste and finish**
   Open the lid and stir. If you'd like a creamier texture, mash a few chickpeas or blend part of the curry.
   Adjust salt and squeeze in lemon juice. Garnish with cilantro or yogurt if desired.

**Using canned chickpeas:**

* Replace soaked chickpeas with 2 cans (400 g each), drained.
* Pressure cook for only 10–12 minutes, or simmer uncovered for 20–25 minutes.

### Freezing and Reheating Tips

#### Freezing:

* Let food cool completely before freezing.
* Use sealed glass or plastic containers with a bit of headroom.
* Label and freeze for up to 3 months.

#### Reheating:

* Thaw in the fridge overnight if possible.
* Or run the container under warm water to release the frozen block, then reheat in a pot with a splash of water.
* Stir gently and re-season if needed.
